# BeastieBot
An auto-rap generator that creates a rap inspired by a user-input topic.

1. On a Unix based system, download the code from our Github repository. 
2. Download the modules TwitterSearch and profanity. This can be done form the command Terminal by calling "sudo pip install TwitterSearch" and "sudo pip install profanity".
3. Request your own Twitter API key here. 
4. Once you have your key, copy and paste it into the file BeastieBot.py where it says "#### PUT apidict HERE ####"  by creating a variable "apidict = {0: YOUR API KEY HERE}".
5. You will need to provide your own sick beat for recording your raps, a wav file, which you should put in the same folder and name "background.wav." This will play as a background beat when you record your raps.
 6. Open BeastieBot.py from Terminal to open up a new window with Beastie Bot's GUI.
7. Enter the word you would like to rhyme with, the number of lines, and whether you want a clean rap.
8. Click Enter and your rap will begin to display! After a few seconds, it will also begin to record and play your beat so that you can rap your verse to the beat.
9. You can access and play your most recent rap from the same folder, which will be saved as "rap.wav".

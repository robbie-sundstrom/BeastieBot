# BeastieBot
An auto-rap generator that creates a rap inspired by a user-input topic.

1. On a Unix based system, download the code from our Github repository here.
2. Request your own Twitter API key here. 
3. Once you have your key, copy and paste it into the file BeastieBot.py where it says "#### PUT apidict HERE ####."
4. You will need to provide your own sick beat for recording your raps, a wav file, which you should put in the same folder and name "intergalactic.wav." This will play as a background beat when you record your raps.
5. Open gui.py from Terminal to open up a new window with Beastie Bot's GUI.
6. Enter the word you would like to rhyme with, the number of lines, and whether you want a clean rap.
7. Click Enter and then Record to receive your lyrics and then record your own rap!
8. Click Play if you want to hear your most recently recorded rap.

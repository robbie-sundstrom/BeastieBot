# BeastieBot
Beastie Bot is an auto-rap generator that creates a rap inspired by a user-input topic. To run Beastie Bot, download all the provided code to your computer. The main file is gui.py, which when run, opens up a GUI you can use to create your own rap. You will need to provide your own sick beat for recording your raps, a wav file, which you should put in the same folder and name "intergalactic.wav.

Due to legal issues, we are unable to provide our Twitter API key for this project, meaning that you must download your own to run the program. You can request your own Twitter API key at https://apps.twitter.com/app/new. Once you have your key, copy and paste it into the file BeastieBot.py where it says "#### PUT apidict HERE ####".
